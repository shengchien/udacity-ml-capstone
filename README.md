### Description
This is my capstone project for Udacity Machine Learning Nanodegree. The project is based on the [proposal](https://github.com/shengchien/udacity-ml-capstone/blob/master/proposal.pdf) submitted earlier as a part of the capstone project. The topic is **_Sentiment Analysis with Word2Vec and XGBoost_**.

### Dataset
The dataset used in this project can be found at [Large Movie Review Dataset](http://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/) which was originally collected by

> Andrew  L.  Maas,  Raymond  E.  Daly,  Peter  T.  Pham,  Dan  Huang,  An-drew Y. Ng, and Christopher Potts.  Learning word vectors for sentimentanalysis.   InProceedings of the 49th Annual Meeting of the Associationfor Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, pages 142â€“150,  Portland,  Oregon,  USA,  June  2011.  Association  for  ComputationalLinguistics.

### Getting Started

Here are the requirements in order to run the project.

#### Software Requirements

Any versions compatible should be sufficient.

| Software | Version |
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| jupyter notebook | 5.4.0 |
| python | 3.6.5 |
| numpy | 1.14.2 |
| panda | 0.22.0 |
| gensim | 3.4.0 |

#### Unpack Dataset

For convenience, the files from the original dataset have been preprocessed and saved in dataset.zip. Unzip the file before running the project.

```
$ unzip dataset.zip
```

#### Launch Jupyter Notebook

```
$ jupyter notebook SentimentAnalysis.ipynb
```
